## Introduction

A couple discovered their mortgage could function far more effectively than initially believed. While refinancing often focuses on interest rates, this case demonstrates how restructuring finances can reduce stress and enhance cash flow.

## The Situation: More Than Just a Rate

MA and FA contacted Loan Studio despite managing reasonable repayments at 5.49%. Their challenge involved juggling multiple debts:

- Two credit cards nearing their limits ($8,000 and $7,000 combined)
- An outstanding car loan with $20,000 remaining
- Monthly repayments totaling $4,501

Despite their ability to make payments, managing diverse debt streams constrained their financial flexibility.

## The Solution: Home Loan Health Check

Loan Studio recommended a comprehensive Home Loan Health Check, resulting in a three-part strategy:

- Refinancing to a 5.39% variable rate
- Consolidating automotive and credit card debts into their mortgage
- Releasing $15,000 for home improvements

This approach prioritized structural simplification over chasing the lowest advertised rates.

## The Outcome: Simplified Finances & Improved Cash Flow

The refinancing delivered measurable benefits:

- Reduced loan splits from multiple to two
- Monthly cash flow increase of $1,080
- Available funds for home improvements
- Enhanced flexibility for additional repayments

## Why a Home Loan Health Check Matters

This service can help homeowners by identifying opportunities to reduce monthly payments, consolidate multiple debts, release equity, and improve overall financial flexibility.

## Call to Action

Those who haven't reviewed their mortgage within 12 months should consider scheduling a Home Loan Health Check with Loan Studio.
