## Introduction

Today's lending landscape requires strategic thinking beyond simply chasing lower rates. Refinancing can unlock financial flexibility, boost cash flow, and create opportunities for portfolio expansion. Loan Studio recently assisted an investor in refinancing their existing loan, which delivered both immediate savings and equity access for future investments.

## The Scenario: An Investment Loan Ready for a Refresh

The client's initial position:

- **Loan size:** $765,000
- **Interest rate:** 5.81% (Interest Only)
- **Monthly payment:** Approximately $3,700

While not unfavorable, the rate lacked competitiveness, and the borrower faced substantial annual loan fees.

## Key Client Objectives

1. Enhance cash flow management
2. Access equity for their next property acquisition

## Results Achieved Through Refinancing

**New loan terms:**

- **Interest rate:** 5.54% (Interest Only)
- **Monthly payment:** Approximately $3,530
- **Annual savings:** $2,040 in repayments
- **Fee elimination:** $395 annually (new lender charges no fees)

**Total 3-Year Savings:** $7,305

Additionally, the refinance strategy unlocked **$140,000 in usable equity** for deposit contributions and closing costs on their next investment property.

## Why Refinancing Matters for Investors

Many borrowers remain with their original lenders for years, potentially missing opportunities. Benefits of refinancing include:

- Reduced interest costs
- Improved monthly cash flow
- Equity leverage for expansion
- Tax-efficient loan structuring
- Enhanced investment strategy positioning

## Signs Refinancing May Be Worthwhile

Consider reviewing your loan if:

- Rates haven't been checked in 6-12 months
- You're planning additional property purchases
- Competitors offer better terms
- Your lender charges unnecessary fees
- Cash flow improvement is desired
