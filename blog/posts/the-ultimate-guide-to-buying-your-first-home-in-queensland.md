## Introduction

Prospective Queensland homebuyers in 2025–2026 have access to multiple financial incentives that can significantly reduce upfront acquisition expenses and borrowing requirements. This guide outlines the primary incentive programs, eligibility criteria, application procedures, and critical deadlines.

## The First Home Owner Grant (FHOG) — Details & Important Dates

**Amount & Timeline:**

The program currently offers **$30,000 for eligible purchases of new homes** until June 30, 2026. After this date, the benefit is expected to decrease to $15,000.

**Eligibility Basics:**

First-time buyers purchasing newly constructed properties (houses, townhouses, units, or off-the-plan builds) valued below $750,000 may qualify. Residency requirements and move-in timelines also apply.

**Application Process:**

Applications proceed through the Queensland Revenue Office or via a conveyancer/settlement agent using official state forms.

**Impact:**

The grant reduces required cash at settlement, potentially eliminating lenders mortgage insurance necessity.

## Stamp Duty Changes

**Reform Overview:**

Effective May 1, 2025, Queensland implemented transfer duty reforms offering first-home buyers of new properties full exemptions from stamp duty when eligibility conditions are satisfied.

**Key Advantage:**

No value cap on exemption now applies to many new home scenarios, enabling broader taxpayer participation and generating substantial savings compared to traditional acquisition expenses.

## Queensland's "Boost to Buy" Shared-Equity Program

The 2025 budget introduced a shared-equity initiative permitting eligible purchasers to acquire properties with reduced deposits (government contributes up to 30% for new homes, 25% for established properties in select scenarios). This approach accommodates buyers facing deposit constraints through shared ownership structures.

## Federal First Home Guarantee

The federal government expanded its first-home guarantee scheme, permitting qualified buyers to purchase with as little as 5% down payment without lenders mortgage insurance. Increased price caps and broadened eligibility expanded program accessibility in 2025–2026.

## Practical Checklist

1. Verify FHOG eligibility and deadline adherence for new home purchases under $750,000
2. Confirm stamp duty exemption qualification for contracts dated after May 1, 2025
3. Investigate federal low-deposit options and compatibility with state incentives
4. Budget for conveyancing, lender fees, and construction-related expenses
5. Obtain pre-approval and financial strategy consultation prior to contract execution

## FAQs

**Combined Incentive Eligibility:**

Both the $30,000 FHOG and stamp duty exemption can be stacked for qualifying new home purchases.

**"New Home" Definition:**

Newly constructed properties, substantially renovated residences, and off-the-plan acquisitions typically qualify; established resale properties generally do not.

**Post-June 2026 Timeline:**

Contracts executed after June 30, 2026 would access the reduced $15,000 standard grant amount unless government policy extends current terms.

**Interstate Buyer Considerations:**

Citizenship, permanent residency, and move-in requirements may apply; verification through official channels is essential.

**Self-Built Scenarios:**

Building on personal vacant land qualifies for the $30,000 FHOG provided combined land-plus-home valuation remains under $750,000.

**Incentive Stacking:**

State and federal programs operate independently, permitting qualified buyers to combine the FHOG, stamp duty exemption, and 5% deposit guarantee approaches.
