## Overview

Prospective homebuyers in Australia have reason to celebrate. The Federal Government confirmed that the new 5% First Home Buyer Scheme will now roll out on October 1st, 2025 – substantially ahead of the original 2026 timeline.

## What is the First Home Buyer Scheme?

The First Home Buyer Guarantee (FHBG), commonly referred to as the 5% deposit home loan scheme, permits eligible first-time purchasers to acquire property with just a 5% down payment while avoiding Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI).

**How it operates:**

- Standard requirements typically demand a 20% deposit to sidestep LMI
- Government backing covers up to 15% of the loan value
- Buyers can enter the market with minimal down payment while circumventing insurance costs

## Key Features of the 2025 Scheme

- **Early availability** starting October 1, 2025
- **Minimal deposit requirement** of just 5%
- **No LMI costs** thanks to government guarantee
- **No income restrictions** and unlimited participant slots
- **Elevated property price thresholds** varying by location:
  - Sydney: approximately $1.5M
  - Melbourne: approximately $950K
  - Brisbane: approximately $1M

## Eligibility Requirements

Applicants must:

- Be first-time property buyers or demonstrate no property ownership within the past decade
- Hold Australian citizenship or permanent residency
- Be at least 18 years old
- Commit to owner-occupancy within six months

## Financial Benefits

- **Sydney homes** (~$844k median): approximately $34,000 in avoided insurance
- **Brisbane properties** (~$1M): around $42,000 savings on a $50,000 deposit
- **Regional areas** like Bendigo (~$600k): approximately $25,000 in reduced costs
