## February Financial Reset: How Debt Consolidation Can Help You Take Back Control After the Holidays

By February, reality sets in after the holidays end. School reopens, routines return, and for many Australians, substantial bills arrive. The festive season and summer break typically involve significant spending on gifts, travel, dining, and back-to-school items, leaving households financially stretched as the year begins.

## Why February Is a Turning Point for Your Finances

Post-holiday spending typically includes:

- Gifts and celebrations
- Travel and accommodation
- Eating out and entertainment
- Back-to-school expenses

**Key Australian statistics:**

- Approximately **$28 billion charged to credit cards over December** with nearly **$18 billion now accruing interest**
- Buy-now-pay-later products are now regulated similarly to traditional credit, meaning missed payments can damage credit scores
- ASIC research indicates many Australians exceed budgets during the festive period and feel the impact throughout the new year

**Common February challenges include:**

- Persistent credit card balances
- Ongoing BNPL repayments affecting cash flow
- Depleted savings
- Immediate school-related expenses

February becomes pivotal for asking: "How do I reset my finances for the rest of the year?"

## What is Debt Consolidation?

This strategy combines multiple high-interest debts—such as credit cards, buy-now-pay-later accounts, car loans, and personal loans—into one simplified, lower-cost repayment, often within a home loan structure.

## Benefits of Debt Consolidation

- Reduced monthly repayment pressure
- Lower total interest paid
- Single straightforward payment instead of multiple ones
- Improved cash flow
- Faster savings rebuilding
- Decreased financial stress

## Real Client Story: From Overwhelmed to in Control

A couple came seeking help despite earning good incomes—most money went directly to repayments each month.

**Before consolidation:**

- Home loan: $450,000 remaining @ 5.49% = $2,711/month
- Car loan: $40,000 = $850/month
- Credit cards: $22,000 combined = $660/month
- BNPL: $1,000 = $75/month
- **Total monthly repayments: $4,296**

**After refinancing and consolidating:**

- Refinanced home loan @ 5.29% = $2,496/month
- Consolidated debt loan split = $293/month
- **New total: $2,789/month**
- **Monthly savings: $1,507**

Beyond financial relief, this restructuring provided emotional benefits: reduced stress, improved breathing room, clearer direction, and confidence moving forward.

## Why Acting in February Matters

Unaddressed post-holiday debt compounds over months through accumulating interest and reduced budgeting flexibility. Earlier intervention enables faster cost reduction, interest savings, improved cash flow, and financial confidence rebuilding.

## Is Debt Consolidation Right for You?

Consider this approach if you have home equity, manage multiple high-interest debts, want one clear repayment, and are ready to rebuild financial control.

## Ready for a Financial Reset?

A complimentary debt review can demonstrate potential repayment restructuring, monthly savings opportunities, and whether consolidation suits your situation. Let February mark your financial turning point.
