## RBA Holds Rates on 4 November 2025 – What That Means for Borrowers

On November 4, 2025, the Reserve Bank of Australia's Monetary Policy Board maintained the official cash rate at 3.60%. Though widely anticipated, the accompanying commentary signals a more cautious stance with significant implications for mortgage holders.

## Key Economic Data

**Cash Rate & Inflation:**

- Official cash rate: 3.60% (unchanged)
- Headline CPI: 3.2% year-on-year
- Trimmed-mean inflation: 3.0% annualized
- RBA forecasts trimmed-mean inflation rising to ~3.2% before declining toward ~2.6% by end-2027

**Labour Market:**

- Unemployment rose to 4.5% in September 2025
- Trend unemployment remained ~4.3%
- Employment growth weak at +14,900 jobs in September

**Economic Activity:**

The RBA noted that "private demand is recovering" and the "economy is growing at close to its speed limit," limiting inflation-dampening capacity.

## RBA's Core Message

The Board emphasized that recent inflation upticks partly stem from temporary factors (electricity, fuel, council rates) but also reflect persistent increases in new dwellings and services. Critically, the Board "did not consider cutting the cash rate" at this meeting, signaling a "hold for longer" stance.

## Implications for Borrowers

**Rate Relief Timeline:** Borrowers shouldn't expect significant mortgage rate drops near-term, as lenders will likely maintain cautious variable and fixed-rate positioning.

**Refinancing Considerations:** Those on higher variable rates face trade-offs between locking in fixed rates now versus waiting for potential future cuts.

**Affordability Pressures:** Rising housing costs, rents, and construction expenses continue straining borrowers despite limited servicing relief.

## Bank Predictions on Next Rate Cut

- **Commonwealth Bank:** No further cuts this cycle
- **ANZ:** First cut likely February 2026 (~3.35%)
- **NAB:** Cut possibly May 2026 (~3.35%)
- **Westpac:** Cuts potentially May and August 2026 (~3.10% by year-end)

**Bottom Line:** Rate relief unlikely in 2025, with earliest relief window early-to-mid 2026, contingent on inflation, employment, and housing cost developments.
