## Overview

As 2025 wraps up, one thing is clear; it was another year of change, recalibration and cautious optimism across Australian property and lending markets. Buyers, property owners, and investors navigated shifting conditions and evolving policies throughout the year.

## The Australian Property Market in 2025

Regional performance varied significantly:

- **Queensland and Western Australia** led growth through interstate migration, affordability, and strong employment
- **South Australia** surprised with steady gains in family-friendly suburbs
- **Victoria** experienced subdued performance influenced by higher holding costs and investor hesitation
- **New South Wales** saw mixed results, with premium areas holding firm while outer suburbs softened

Overall price growth moderated compared to previous years, though demand for well-positioned, liveable homes remained robust.

## Interest Rates & RBA Decisions

The Reserve Bank maintained focus on balancing inflation control with economic stability. Rate movements were less aggressive than prior years, yet timing uncertainty kept borrowers attentive.

Key impacts included:

- Extended periods of higher repayments for households
- Increased refinancing activity as borrowers sought competitive rates and flexible features
- More strategic fixed versus variable loan discussions

## Government Schemes & Lending Support

Several initiatives continued supporting market entry:

- First Home Guarantee programs with reduced deposit requirements
- State-based grants and stamp duty concessions
- Ongoing policy discussions around housing supply and affordability

## Borrower Behaviour Shifts

Australians demonstrated changing financial priorities:

- More intentional discretionary spending choices
- Renewed emphasis on savings buffers
- Prioritization of debt reduction and repayment flexibility

Rather than maximizing borrowing capacity, buyers increasingly chose sustainable long-term solutions.

## Recommendations for 2026

### For Existing Mortgage Holders

- Review current rates and loan structures for potential savings
- Maximize offset account effectiveness
- Consider strategic repayment adjustments
- Approach rate changes strategically rather than reactively

### For Prospective Buyers

- Understand borrowing capacity before property hunting
- Pursue pre-approvals to strengthen negotiating position
- Focus on controllable variables: deposits, timing, loan structure
- Avoid waiting for perfect market conditions

## Looking Ahead

Property isn't about timing the market, it's about time in the market, paired with smart advice. Strategic planning and professional guidance remain essential for financial confidence and control.
